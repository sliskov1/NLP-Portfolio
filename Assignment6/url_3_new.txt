Murphy's performance were made to secure an "R" rating.[4]Records[edit]The film surpassed Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip as the highest grossing concert film with a gross of $50.5 million.[5][3]The film contained the word "fuck" 223 times,[6] setting the record for highest "fuck count" ever in a feature-length, theatrically released film at the time (surpassing Scarface).Raw held the record until 1990 before being surpassed by Goodfellas.Critical reception[edit]The New York Times praised Eddie Murphy's stand-up routine.[7][8][9][10]Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was "a surprisingly poor concert film of Murphys stand-up act," saying Murphy is "like a musician with fabulous technique playing 'Chopsticks.'"[11]Tatyana Ali's The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air co-star Alfonso Ribeiro later claimed to have drawn inspiration from Murphy's depiction of white people dancing in developing "The Carlton" for his character Carlton Banks.[12]On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 77% from 22 reviews with the consensus: "Like its title suggests, Eddie Murphy Raw is a searingly unbridled and viciously funny showcase from one of comedy's best."[13]Home video[edit]On July 12, 1988 the film was released on VHS.The film was also released on DVD October 5, 2004.See also[edit]Eddie Murphy filmographyReferences[edit]^ "Eddie Murphy Raw
