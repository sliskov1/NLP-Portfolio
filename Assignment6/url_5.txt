Court documents seen by DailyMail.com show Mel B and Eddie Murphy have modified their child support agreement for 15-year-old daughter Angel Iris Murphy Brown (pictured right with her mother in 2016)         Mel, who has two other daughters - Phoenix Chi Gulzar (far left) and Madison Brown Belafonte ( (center) - from previous relationships, gave birth to Angel Iris Murphy Brown, on Murphy's 46th birthday, April 3, 2007The payments are to be made retroactively beginning from last October up until Angel turns 18.He also agrees to cover Brown's attorney fees of $10,000.'The parties agree that Respondent (Murphy) is an "extraordinarily high earner"' ...,' court documents state.'The amount of child support set forth hereinbelow has been calculated based on the reasonable needs of the minor child...'Commencing October 1, 2021, as and for child support for the benefit of Angel, Respondent shall pay to Petitioner the sum of $35,000 per month.'Child support shall be payable via wire transfer, and shall be due on the first calendar day of each month.'The filing, however, notes that Brown will be responsible for 'add-on' costs, which include health insurance, health care, extracurricular activities, and educational expenses for Angel.It also states the agreement is a 'non-guideline child support order', meaning 'a material change of circumstances' is not required for modification.Brown first filed papers asking for more child support in October 2020, claimingher income had decreased dramatically.'Until recently, Melanie has been fortunate in her career to sustain a comfortable lifestyle for herself and Angel,' the filing stated.              Initially Murphy - who now has ten children with five different women - repeatedly refused to have anything to do with Mel or their child, sparking a bitter paternity battle         The Spice Girl, 47, filed court documents in 2020 after her income was dramatically reduced and requested that the comedian also cover her attorney expenses (pictured in 2011)         Mel B - pictured with Angel in a social media photo - had reportedly attempted to resolve the case 'numerous times' and 'without court intervention' before filing the papers last year    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       EXCLUSIVE: Husband of Kamala Harris's key advisor is accused...
