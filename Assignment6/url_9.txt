The Hollywood star has upped the monthly payments from $25,000 to $35,000 for his daughter Angel Iris Murphy Brown.  The former Spice girl filed legal papers seeking more financial assistance from the Beverly Hill Cop actor two years ago. Court documents obtained by The Daily Mail show the parents reacher the new child support agreement after Mel cited a 'dramatic income reduction'.  Murphy had been paying pop star $25,000 a month, which works out to $300,00 a year, since their paternity dispute was settled back in February 2009. The new arrangement, which identified Murphy as an 'extraordinarily high earner', will now see the comedian send an extra $10,000 a month, the Mirror reports.

Murphy also agreed to cover Brown's attorney fees which were $10,000. The court documents say: "The parties agree that Respondent (Murphy) is an 'extraordinarily high earner,' The amount of child support set forth hereinbelow has been calculated based on the reasonable needs of the minor child... Murphy has a total of ten children with five different women.

Child support shall be payable via wire transfer, and shall be due on the first calendar day of each month." However, the filing states that Brown will be responsible for any 'add-on' costs. This can include health care, education expenses, health insurance and extracurricular activities. The agreement is a 'non-guideline child support order', which means 'a material change of circumstances' is not required for modification. Mel B first filed the papers requesting extra child support back in October 2020, saying her income had decreased dramatically. Mel B requested more financial assistance due to a 'dramatic income reduction'. (Image: Mirror) It said: "Until recently, Melanie has been fortunate in her career to sustain a comfortable lifestyle for herself and Angel. Unfortunately, Melanie's income has dramatically reduced, such that she must consider modifying child support for the first time." Mel gave birth to Angel on Murphy's 46th birthday, April 3, 2007. It was announced on June 22, 2007 that a DNA test had confirmed that Murphy was the father.

However, this changed in 2017. Mel talked about their split in her 2018 memoir and said it was thanks to Murphy's mother, Lillian Lynch, that Angel was reunited with her dad in May 2017 and the two now have a close relationship with each other. Murphy has a total of ten children with five different women. Mel has two other daughters from a previous relationship.  Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.
