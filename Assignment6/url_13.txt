The actor will now pay $35,000, an increase of $10,000, in monthly child support for his daughter Angel Iris Murphy Brown. This comes two years after the former Spice Girl filed papers requesting more financial assistance.  Court documents seen by The Daily Mail show the parents have agreed to a new child support arrangement after Mel cited a change in her income.  Murphy had been paying the singer $25,000 a month, which is $300,00 a year, since they settled their paternity battle back in February 2009. The new modified agreement says Murphy, who is identified in the filing as an 'extraordinarily high earner', will have to now give an extra $10,000 a month.

Murphy also agreed to cover Brown's attorney fees which were $10,000. The court documents say: "The parties agree that Respondent (Murphy) is an 'extraordinarily high earner,' "The amount of child support set forth hereinbelow has been calculated based on the reasonable needs of the minor child... "Commencing October 1, 2021, as and for child support for the benefit of Angel, Respondent shall pay to Petitioner the sum of $35,000 per month. "Child support shall be payable via wire transfer, and shall be due on the first calendar day of each month." However, the filing states that Brown will be responsible for any 'add-on' costs. This can include health care, education expenses, health insurance and extracurricular activities. The agreement is a 'non-guideline child support order', which means 'a material change of circumstances' is not required for modification. Mel B first filed the papers requesting extra child support back in October 2020, saying her income had decreased dramatically. Mel had daughter Angel in 2007 It said: "Until recently, Melanie has been fortunate in her career to sustain a comfortable lifestyle for herself and Angel. Unfortunately, Melanie's income has dramatically reduced, such that she must consider modifying child support for the first time." Mel gave birth to Angel on Murphy's 46th birthday, April 3, 2007. It was announced on June 22, 2007 that a DNA test had confirmed that Murphy was the father. At first Murphy didn't have much to do with his daughter, with reports claiming he insisted that she had tricked him into getting pregnant. However, this changed in 2017. Mel talked about their split in her 2018 memoir and said it was thanks to Murphy's mother, Lillian Lynch, that Angel was reunited with her dad in May 2017 and the two now have a close relationship with each other. Murphy has a total of ten children with five different women. Mel has two other daughters from a previous relationship.
